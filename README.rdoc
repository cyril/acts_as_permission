= Acts as permission

This Rails plugin provides a list of permissions attached to a resource, according to ACL concept.  Permissions determine specific access rights for a resource depending of its controller actions such as: show, edit, update, destroy, evaluated from the given resource and such as: index, new, create, evaluated from the parent of the given resource.

Each permission field attributed to a resource can be defined as true, false or nil.  When a resource permission is set as nil, the same permission is searched from its nearest relative to its parent farthest and the first given boolean value is returned.  If permission is nil for a resource and its potential parents, then the method returns false.
